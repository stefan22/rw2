- col-auto
  + use enough columns to accomodate content

- col, col-sm, col-md
  + use for remaining columns, once a first value already been given.

  + pull-md-3, push-md-4 (push and pull)

  + offset-1, offset-3

- flex-last, flex-first
  + allow us to reposition content - same as push and pull

  ex:
    <div class="col-sm-3 col-md-4 flex-last">

- ul class of "list-unstyled"

- adding `align-items-center` vertically aligns content within row
